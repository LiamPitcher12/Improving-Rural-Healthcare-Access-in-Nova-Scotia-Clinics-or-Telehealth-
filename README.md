# Improving Rural Healthcare Access in Nova Scotia Clinics or Telehealth

## Decision Statement
Should the Nova Scotia Department of Health prioritize expanding physical rural clinics or investing further in telehealth services to improve healthcare access for rural populations?

## Executive Summary

Access to primary healthcare remains a persistent challenge for rural communities across Nova Scotia. Geographic isolation, physician shortages, and an aging population have increased pressure on the provincial healthcare system, leading to longer wait times and reduced access to timely care. As demand continues to rise, the Nova Scotia Department of Health faces a strategic decision on how best to allocate limited resources to improve healthcare access for rural residents.

The Deputy Minister of Health must decide whether to prioritize the expansion of physical rural clinics or to invest further in telehealth services. Expanding clinics may improve continuity of care and in-person service availability but requires significant capital investment and additional healthcare workers who are already in short supply. Telehealth services, on the other hand, offer broader geographic coverage and lower infrastructure costs but may raise concerns around quality of care, technology access, and patient adoption.

This project evaluates both options using publicly available healthcare, demographic, and population data to assess their impact on access, system capacity, and long-term sustainability. By applying a decision intelligence framework and systems thinking, this analysis aims to provide evidence-based insights to support an informed policy decision.

## Causal Loop Diagram (CLD) 

The initial Causal Loop Diagram illustrates the key feedback mechanisms influencing rural healthcare access in Nova Scotia. The diagram identifies two primary feedback loops: a balancing loop related to telehealth investment and a reinforcing loop related to healthcare workforce strain. The balancing loop shows how increased investment in telehealth can improve healthcare access, enabling earlier diagnosis and treatment. Earlier intervention reduces overall system workload, which in turn helps limit physician burnout and stabilize service capacity over time.

In contrast, the reinforcing loop highlights how physician burnout reduces workforce availability, leading to decreased healthcare access and increased patient backlogs. Growing backlogs place additional pressure on the healthcare system, further increasing workload and exacerbating burnout. Together, these feedback loops demonstrate that improving healthcare access is not solely a matter of increasing service availability, but also requires addressing underlying workforce constraints to ensure long-term system sustainability.
