# Improving-Rural-Healthcare-Access-in-Nova-Scotia-Clinics-or-Telehealth-
Should the Nova Scotia Department of Health prioritize expanding physical rural clinics or investing further in telehealth services to improve healthcare access for rural populations?

## Executive Summary

Access to primary healthcare remains a persistent challenge for rural communities across Nova Scotia. Geographic isolation, physician shortages, and an aging population have increased pressure on the provincial healthcare system, leading to longer wait times and reduced access to timely care. As demand continues to rise, the Nova Scotia Department of Health faces a strategic decision on how best to allocate limited resources to improve healthcare access for rural residents.

The Deputy Minister of Health must decide whether to prioritize the expansion of physical rural clinics or to invest further in telehealth services. Expanding clinics may improve continuity of care and in-person service availability but requires significant capital investment and additional healthcare workers who are already in short supply. Telehealth services, on the other hand, offer broader geographic coverage and lower infrastructure costs but may raise concerns around quality of care, technology access, and patient adoption.

This project evaluates both options using publicly available healthcare, demographic, and population data to assess their impact on access, system capacity, and long-term sustainability. By applying a decision intelligence framework and systems thinking, this analysis aims to provide evidence-based insights to support an informed policy decision.
