# Rural Healthcare Access in Nova Scotia

Access to primary healthcare remains a persistent challenge for rural communities across Nova Scotia. Compared to urban residents, rural populations face longer travel times to healthcare facilities, fewer available physicians, and higher proportions of elderly residents with complex healthcare needs. These challenges have contributed to delayed diagnoses, increased emergency room usage, and poorer overall health outcomes. As demand for healthcare services continues to rise, improving rural healthcare access has become a critical policy issue for the Nova Scotia Department of Health.

The Deputy Minister of Health must decide whether to prioritize expanding physical rural clinics or to further invest in telehealth services as a means of improving access. Expanding rural clinics can improve continuity of care, provide essential in-person services, and strengthen community trust in the healthcare system. However, this option requires significant capital investment and depends heavily on recruiting and retaining healthcare professionals—an ongoing challenge given widespread physician shortages and high levels of burnout across the province. Building new clinics without sufficient staffing risks underutilized infrastructure and limited long-term impact.

Alternatively, telehealth services offer the potential to reach a larger number of rural residents at a lower marginal cost. Virtual care can reduce travel barriers, improve access to specialists, and enable earlier diagnosis and treatment, which may reduce pressure on emergency departments. The rapid expansion of telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated its feasibility and acceptance among many patients and providers. Nevertheless, telehealth is not a complete substitute for in-person care. Certain medical conditions require physical examination, and some rural residents face barriers related to broadband access, digital literacy, or personal preference. Concerns also remain regarding continuity of care and the quality of patient-provider relationships in a virtual setting.

This decision is further complicated by workforce constraints within Nova Scotia’s healthcare system. Physician burnout and staffing shortages create reinforcing pressures that reduce access and increase system strain. Investments that improve efficiency and reduce workload may help stabilize the workforce, while poorly aligned investments may exacerbate existing shortages. As a result, the Deputy Minister must consider not only immediate access improvements, but also the long-term sustainability of the healthcare system.

Key stakeholders affected by this decision include rural residents, healthcare professionals, provincial policymakers, technology providers, and taxpayers. Rural communities have a strong interest in equitable access to care, while healthcare workers are directly affected by workload, burnout, and workplace conditions. Government decision-makers must balance fiscal responsibility with public expectations for accessible and high-quality healthcare.

This project uses publicly available data from the Canadian Institute for Health Information, the Nova Scotia Department of Health, and Statistics Canada to evaluate the tradeoffs between rural clinic expansion and telehealth investment. By applying a decision intelligence and systems thinking approach, this analysis aims to provide evidence-based insights to support a strategic policy decision that improves healthcare access while maintaining system sustainability.
